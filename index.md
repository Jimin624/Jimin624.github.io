I am a cognitive scientist who is passionate to investigate how people process, learn, and think. My research particularly focuses on cognitive mechanisms underlying the number comprehension - field called **numercial cognition**. 

How would you compare these two numbers: 12 and 25? 
What if those numbers are presented as bars in a graph?
What if you compare the numbers in another language?
There could be *more happening* than you think!
