I am a PhD candidate in Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota. My dissertation connects two areas of my interest - numerical cognition and data visualizations. The proposed research applies theories and experimental paradigms from numerical cognition to investigate how people understand the numerical information conveyed in bar graphs. My aim is to find cognitive mechanisms underlying bar graph comprehension and help people better understand data visualizations! 

My research investigates how people process, learn, and think. I particularly focus on cognitive mechanisms underlying the number comprehension - field called **numercial cognition**. Please go to [Research](https://jimin624.github.io/research/) to know more about what I do.

I am also an Instructional Technology Fellow for the College of Education and Human Development. I, as a part of the Digial Education and Innoavation team, assist instructors in developing courses that encourage student engagement and maximize learning experiences.
