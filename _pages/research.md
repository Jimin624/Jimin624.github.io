How would you compare these two numbers: 12 and 25?
> What if those numbers are presented as bars in a graph?
> What if you compare the numbers in another language?

### Current Research

## Previous Research
### Language Compatibility Effect in Processing Fractions
I first investigated if a language privileges its naming of a number. The study was done in the context of fractions where English names the numerator of a fraction first whereas Korean names the denominator first. 

### Does Instruction Influence Processing Reducible Fractions (e.g., 2/6)? 
Then research expanded to educational aspect: how people reason about reducible fractions (e.g., 4/6) versus irreducible fractions (e.g., 2/3). I recently extended research area to data visualization. Her research currently explores whether numerical magnitudes are recruited to understand bar graphs, and thus inform the design of bar graphs that simplify their understanding.
