How would you compare these two numbers: 57 and 21?
> What about comparing 35 and 29?
> What if those numbers are presented as bars in a graph?
> What if you compare the numbers in another language?
> There could be *more happening* than you think!

### Current Research (Dissertation!)
My dissertation connects two important areas in cognitive science - numerical cognition and data visualizations. The research applies theories and experimental paradigms from numerical cognition to investigate whether people recruit magnitude representations to understand the numerical values depicted in bar graphs. My plan is to run three experiments for dissertation. They will evaluate theory-driven predictions concerning the relative efficacy of vertical vs. horizontal bars, how people resolve conflicts between the magnitudes of bars and the numerical values they depict, and the role of gridlines in improving bar graph comprehension. 

I am almost done with data collecting and I plan to graduate in May 2023 (fingers crossed).
If you want to follow my progress, you can take a look at my [Poster Presented at VIS 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZKrLijuqF27j4F1QNJvdUd2-Gnpunmx/view?usp=sharing)

### Previous Research
#### Language Compatibility Effect in Processing Fractions
I first investigated if a language privileges its naming of a number. The study was done in the context of fractions where English names the numerator of a fraction first whereas Korean names the denominator first. 

#### Does Instruction Influence Processing Reducible Fractions (e.g., 2/6)? 
Then research expanded to educational aspect: how people reason about reducible fractions (e.g., 4/6) versus irreducible fractions (e.g., 2/3). I recently extended research area to data visualization. Her research currently explores whether numerical magnitudes are recruited to understand bar graphs, and thus inform the design of bar graphs that simplify their understanding.
