Here are some questions for you:
> How would you compare these two numbers: 57 and 21?<br>
> What about comparing 35 and 29?<br>
> What if those numbers are presented as bars in a graph?<br>
> What if you compare the numbers in another language?<br>
There could be *more happening* than you think!

## Current Research (Dissertation)
My dissertation connects two important areas in cognitive science - numerical cognition and data visualizations. The research applies theories and experimental paradigms from numerical cognition to investigate whether people recruit magnitude representations to understand the numerical values depicted in bar graphs. I plan to run three experiments for dissertation. They will evaluate theory-driven predictions concerning the relative efficacy of vertical vs. horizontal bars, how people resolve conflicts between the magnitudes of bars and the numerical values they depict, and the role of gridlines in improving bar graph comprehension. <br>

* I am almost done with data collection. I plan to graduate in May 2023 (fingers crossed). <br>

* I also presented my dissertation proposal at the doctoral colloquium at VIS 2022.

## Previous Research
My previous research focuses on topics in numerical cognition. I have looked at different aspects (language, education) that influence fraction understanding. 

**Language Compatibility Effect in Processing Fractions.** <br>
A language compatibility effect occurs when there is a match between what a language provides and what a mathematical task demands. Here, we investigated whether such an effect exists for fraction processing in English, which names the numerator first, versus Korean, which names the denominator first. We developed two new tasks: a fraction span task where participants view and then recall four fractions and a fraction identification task where they view one fraction and then another and judge whether the two fractions are the same or not. We generally found that English speakers were advantaged when the numerator drove task performance and Korean speakers were advantaged when the denominator was critical. These findings, particularly from the fraction identification task, were inconsistent with the attentional focus hypothesis, which proposes that the serialisation bias of a language guides which fraction component is attended to first. Rather, they were better explained by the verbal encoding hypothesis, which states that a necessary condition for observing language compatibility effects may be that the fraction components must be encoded in verbal working memory and rehearsed there.

**Does Instruction Influence Processing Reducible Fractions (e.g., 2/6)?** <br>
Students are instructed to always reduce fractions to lowest terms, e.g., to transform 4/6 into 2/3. This raises the question of how people process reducible fractions more generally. We investigated the question in two different contexts: whether people reduce fractions to lowest terms (1) when it is task-irrelevant to do so, and thus hurts their performance and also (2) when reducing fractions is task-relevant, and thus doing so should help task performance. <br>
The data collection is completed and we are  writing the manuscript for publication! 

**Interleaved learning of science concepts and its relationship to executive function abilities.** <br>
This study investigated the relative efficacy of interleaved versus blocked instruction and the role of executive function in governing learning from these instructional sequences. Eighth grade students learned about three rock concepts (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic) and their attributes (origin, texture, composition). Consistent with prior studies and as predicted by current theoretical accounts, students who received blocked instruction showed better memory (accuracy on true-false questions) when tested on the same day as instruction, whereas those who received interleaved instruction showed better memory when tested two weeks later. Also consistent with prior studies and theoretical accounts, the blocked group showed greater transfer when tested after a retention interval, although this advantage was only marginally significant. Finally, as predicted, the shifting and inhibition executive function abilities were more predictive of learning from interleaved vs. blocked instruction. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies that combine interleaved instruction with more active learning tasks.

## Other Projects
There are also other projects that I am working on with my labs. 
**Calibration information reduces bias during estimation of factorials: A (partial) replication and extension of Tversky and Kahneman (1973).** <br>
Tversky and Kahneman (1973) found that, under time pressure, people massively underestimated the expansion of 8! (correct value 40,320), and this bias was mitigated for participants presented the descending (8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1; Median=2,250) vs. ascending order (1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8; Median=512). In a first-ever replication (N=140), we also found predominant underestimation, but no significant between-subjects descending vs. ascending order effect. However, when participants then estimated the opposite order, we reproduced this order effect within-subjects. Finally, participants received calibration information (the correct value of 6! or 10!) and again estimated both orders of 8!. Participants who received 10! made more accurate estimates for 8! (Median=38,000), which did not differ statistically from the correct value. Participants who received 6! still grossly underestimated (Median=2,678.5), despite 8! being closer to 6! than 10! in linear and log units. Thus, we surprisingly found the classic factorial estimation bias only within-subjects, and provide evidence for how calibration can reduce it.

**The role of clustering in the efficient solution of small Traveling Salesperson Problems.** <br>
Human solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) are surprisingly close to optimal and unexpectedly efficient. We posit that humans solve instances of the TSP by first clustering the points into smaller regions and then solving each cluster as a simpler TSP. Prior research has shown that participants cluster visual stimuli reliably. That is, their clustering and re-clustering of the same stimulus are similar, especially when the stimulus is relatively more clustered. In this study, participants solved the same TSP instances twice. On the second presentation, half of the instances were flipped about the horizontal and vertical axes. Participants solved the TSP reliably, with their two tours of the same instance sharing 77 percent of the same edges on average. In addition, within-participant reliability was higher for more clustered versus more dispersed instances. Our findings are consistent with the proposal that people use clustering strategies to solve the TSP.
