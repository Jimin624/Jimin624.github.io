In case you want to know more about me: I am originally from Busan, South Korea. I moved to the States when I was 15 years old as an exchange student. Moving to another continent was more challenging than expected. I had to learn a new language, face a new culture, and make new friends. Though the transition was difficult, this was when I started to think about individual differences and how they influence human cogntion. My research questions are often driven from personal experiences (me-search) and that is why I love going outside, exploring something new, throwing questions to the world.

### Why do I do psychology research? 
I enjoy asking questions and finding answers. I always found it fascinating that everyone learns, processes, and thinks differently. Psychology research is a great way to investigate why and how this happens. I also love making implications and applying the findings to the real world settings. This is why my research focuses on questions in education and data visualizations. I plan to expand my research to more areas! 

### What do I do when you are not in office? 
There are many things I do to keep a healthy work-life balance. I love playing tennis, going to the gym, running - anything that helps me sweat and destress! I spend most of my vacation time on traveling to fun places in the world! Some of my favorite places to visit are NYC, Paris, Tokyo, and Seoul. These  cities always keep me entertained with good restaurants, coffee shops, museums, and activities.
