I am a cognitive scientist who is passionate to investigate how people process, learn, and think. My research particularly focuses on cognitive mechanisms underlying the number comprehension - field called **numercial cognition**. 

How would you compare 12 and 25? Do you think comparing 112 and 125 be as easy? Do you think you would compare the numbers the same way if you speak another language? There could be *more happening* than you think! You will be able to know a little bit more about the area if you explore my page! 
 
### Why do you do psychology research? 
I enjoy asking questions and finding answers. I always found it fascinating that everyone learns, processes, and thinks differently. Psychology research is a great way to investigate why and how this happens. I also love making implications and applying the findings to the real world settings. This is why my research focuses on questions in education and data visualizations. I plan to expand my research to more areas! 

### What do you do when you are not in office? 
There are many things I do to keep a healthy work-life balance. I love playing tennis, going to the gym, running - anything that helps me sweat and destress! I spend most of my vacation time on traveling to fun places in the world! Some of my favorite places to visit are NYC, Paris, Tokyo, and Seoul. These  cities always keep me entertained with good restaurants, coffee shops, museums, and activities. 

### More about me
In case you want to know more about me: I am originally from Busan, South Korea. I moved to the States when I was 15 years old as an exchange student. Moving to another continent was more challenging than expected. I had to learn a new language, face a new culture, and make new friends. Though the transition was difficult, this was when I started to think about individual differences in humans and how they influence cogntion. My research questions are often driven from my experiences (me-search) and that is why I love going out there, experiencing something new, throwing questions to the world!
